- make all classes get options from the runner object
- add a probabilistic helper script to calculate statistics on given fields
- add range attribute to each matcher for fine-tuning
- add ability for transformers to chain
- in the specification, use sequences instead of maps where more appropriate
- find a way to only transform fields that have changed since last script/transformer
